Bus Ticket Booking System
Overview
This project is a bus ticket booking system that facilitates the booking of bus tickets for users. It includes various modules such as Bus Operator Management, User Management, Cancellation Handling, Update Functionality, and Ticket Pricing. Additionally, the system integrates with third-party APIs for email notifications, PDF generation, and sandbox accounts for payment testing.

Modules
1. Bus Operator Module
This module manages the details and operations related to bus operators. Bus operators can add, update, or remove their buses and schedules. The module also allows for tracking the availability of buses and assigning them to routes.

2. User Module
The User Module handles user registration, authentication, and booking history. Users can search for available buses, book tickets, and view their booking details.

3. Cancellation Module
This module provides functionality for canceling booked tickets. Users can initiate cancellations within a specified time frame, and refunds are processed accordingly.

4. Update Module
The Update Module allows for the modification of booked tickets or travel details. Users can request changes to their reservations, such as updating the travel date or passenger details.

5. Ticket Pricing Module
The Ticket Pricing Module is responsible for determining the cost of tickets based on various factors, including route, bus type, and seat selection. It ensures transparent and dynamic pricing for users.

Third-Party API Integrations
1. Email Send PDF Service
Integration with a third-party service to send email notifications to users regarding their booking details. PDFs of the tickets are attached to these emails for reference.

2. Payment Testing Sandbox Account
The project utilizes a sandbox account for payment testing. This allows developers to simulate payment transactions without using real money, ensuring the reliability and security of the payment system.
